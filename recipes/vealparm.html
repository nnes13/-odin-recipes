    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you say you're making a really good gluten-free Veal Parmesan or Chicken Parmesan for lunch or dinner, and if you say I am invited, then we are very likely going to be friends, for my heart holds a deep and abiding love those two dishes. Here's a quick, easy and elegant version. I like to make it with veal, but chicken is also delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 thin veal cutlets, about 2 1/2 ounces each</li>
        <li>¾ cup of potato flour, rice flour, cornstarch, or general purpose gluten-free flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup crushed Rice Chex or gluten-free breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups your favorite easy tomato sauce--canned. jarred, whatever might be in the freezer, etc.</li>
        <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>4 ounces mozzarella cheese, preferably fresh, cut 6 1/4-inch-thick slices</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan in a shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine spices in a bowl and mix.</li>
        <li>Heat your oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>On the stove, warm the tomato sauce on a rear burner.</li>
        <li>On another burner, heat ½-inch of oil in large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Don't let oil get smoky. </li>
        <li>Season both sides of the cutlets with the spice mix of salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, oregano, paprika, and cayenne.</li>
        <li>Dredge cutlets in gluten-free flour of choice.</li>
        <li>Then dip cutlets in the beaten egg, then dredge in breadcrumb and cheese mixture, turning to coat both sides. Place 3 cutlets on a plate.</li>
        <li>Place 3 cutlets in skillet; cook until golden, 1 to 2 minutes on each side.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula, transfer browned cutlets to a 10x15 inch baking pan.</li>
        <li>Top off oil in the skillet. Cook the remaining cutlets.</li>
        <li>Place remaining cutlets in baking pan.</li>
        <li>Top each cutlet with a slice of mozzarella.</li>
    </ol>
